# RStartHere
A guide to some of the most useful R Packages that we know about, organized by their role in data science.

[Click here to suggest packages.](https://github.com/rstudio/RStartHere/edit/master/README.Rmd)


## Data Science Workflow 
Each data science project is different, but each follows the same general steps. You:

!["The data science workflow"](data-science.png)


1. [Import](#import) your data into R
2. [Tidy](#tidy) it
3. Understand your data by iteratively 
    a. [visualizing](#visualize)
    b. [tranforming](#transform) and 
    c. [modeling](#modelinfer) your data
4. [Infer](#infer) how your understanding applies to other data sets (_including future data, i.e. predictions_)
5. [Communicate](#communicate) your results to an audience, or
6. [Automate](#automate) your analysis for easy reuse
7. [Program](#program) the whole way through, since you do each of these things on a computer
