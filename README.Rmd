# RStartHere
A guide to some of the most useful R Packages that we know about, organized by their role in data science.

[Click here to suggest packages.](https://github.com/rstudio/RStartHere/edit/master/README.Rmd)


## Data Science Workflow 
Each data science project is different, but each follows the same general steps. You:

!["The data science workflow"](data-science.png)


1. [Import](#import) your data into R
2. [Tidy](#tidy) it
3. Understand your data by iteratively 
    a. [visualizing](#visualize)
    b. [tranforming](#transform) and 
    c. [modeling](#modelinfer) your data
4. [Infer](#infer) how your understanding applies to other data sets (_including future data, i.e. predictions_)
5. [Communicate](#communicate) your results to an audience, or
6. [Automate](#automate) your analysis for easy reuse
7. [Program](#program) the whole way through, since you do each of these things on a computer

Below we list the most useful R packages that we know of for each step.

## Criteria

What makes an R Package useful? A useful R package should perform a useful task, and it should do it well. Here are some criteria that we used to make the list.

* The code in the package runs fast, with few errors.
* The code in the package has an intuitive syntax that is easy to remember.
* The package plays well with other packages; you do not need to munge your data into new forms to use the package.
* The package is widely used and recommended by its users.
* The package has a development website, or series of vignettes, that make the package easy to learn.
* The package is developed in the open (e.g. on Github or RForge).
* The package uses tests to ensure that it will be stable and bug free well into the future.
* The package is stable and available from CRAN, or we are personally involved with the package and committed to its development.

You can learn more about packages in R with the [CRAN task views](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/).
